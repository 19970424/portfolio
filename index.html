<h2 id="1">About me</h2>
<p style="font-family:Segoe UI;" title="Self-Introduction;" class="pad"> I am originally from <a href="http://www.lanxi.gov.cn/" title='Home city' style="color: black;">Lanxi</a>, 
    Zhejiang Province, China, whose city flower is orchid &amp; city tree is camphor. The city is famous for 
    <a href="http://www.lxlds.cn/eabout.asp" title="Homepage" style="color: black;">Lanxi Underground River</a>, 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhuge_Village" title="Wikipedia" style="color: black;">Zhuge Village</a>,
    <a href="http://www.lxmarathon.com/" title="Homepage" style="color: black;">Lanxi Rural Marathon</a>, 
    bayberry, subing (a crisp cake with meigan cai and pork inside). It is the place where I have all childhood memory and adolescent experience.</p>
<p class="pad">I like discovering science, exploring nature and exchanging culture. Also I am a crazy fan of many kinds of sports e.g. ball games, mountains climbing, swimming, cycling, wild running. 
    Since my research is related to the sea, I really enjoy the time spending in the vessel when we do marine investigations. Besides, I have some popular hobbies such as reading books, 
    enjoying the pop music and classic one.</p> 
<p class="pad">
    In April 2023, I started my PhD after 13 months of work. I believe an experience of work can motivate
    me to work smarter, work empirically, work practically. In my perspective, connecting the theoritical 
    knowledge with realistic society & industry is always the pursuit of research although I am not a utilitarianism follower.
    Additionally, I participated in a SDGs-promotion <a href="https://twitter.com/tumsat_SDGs/status/1427783856170536961" title="Jump to twitter" style="color:black;">campaign</a> 
    to call for the recycle of wasted lithium battery of electronics. Unfortunately, this idea was suspended at conceptual stage.

<!-- <p class="pad">Our earth are undergoing several huge environmental risks in anthropogenic history e.g. global warming, biodiversity loss, plastic waste mismanagement etc.-->
<h2 id="2">About my research</h2>
<p class="pad"> 
    I am currently PhD 1<sup>st</sup> year student of <a href="http://lmr.aori.u-tokyo.ac.jp/feog/index.html" title ="ENG version is available" style="color:black;">Fisheries Environmental Oceanography Section</a>,
    the Graduate School of Agriculture and Life Science, the University of Tokyo. Meantime, 
    I am co-affiliated to Department of Living Marine Resources, Atmosphere and Ocean Research Institute (AORI), The University of Tokyo.</p>  
<p class="pad"> My doctor research is about estimating the distribution and transport of microplastics in the past 75 years of the North Pacific Ocean. 
    I am passionate to study the microplastics pollution that is the anthropogenic consequence due to the mismanagement of plastic waste and impatience of consumming.
    We live in a world that cannot be dissociated from plastics materials and meantime, both terrestrial and marine environmental have been 
    broadly as well as inhomogeneously polluted. Moreover, this situation will continue to deteriorate if human being cannot alter their living ways and thinking ways.
    In my opinion, decarbonazation is never equivalent to lower living quality. There must be ways to address this problem.</p>
<p class="pad">In my research, most experimental apparatuses are made of quartz glass or stainless steel to output best and least-contaminated results. I wish that my study can further 
    help to understand the behavior of microplastics and quantify the microplastics pollution not only in the surface but also in the water column and sediments. 
    The teleology of my research is to improve the consciousness of protecting the ocean environment and to provide the latest knowledge and advanced insights of ocean to the public.</p>
