<h1 style="font-size:30px;" style="text-align: center;"> Hi, This is the Website of Haodong XU (Carraway)</h1>
<h2 style="font-size: medium;" style="font-family: serif;" style="text-align: center;">I am Haodong Xu (Carraway). 
    I am currently PhD 1st year student of the Graduate School of Agriculture and Life Science, the University of Tokyo. 
    My doctor research is about estimating the distribution and transport of microplastics in past 75 years of the North Pacific Ocean. 
    I am passionate to study the microplastics pollution that is the anthropogenic consequences due to the mismanagement of plastic waste.
    We live in a world that cannot be dissociated from plastics materials and meantime, both terrestrial and marine environmental have been 
    broadly as well as inhomogeneously polluted. Moreover, this situation will continue to deteriorate if human being cannot alter their living ways and thinking ways.
    In my opinion, decarbonazation is never equivalent to lower living quality.<br>
    In my research, most experimental apparatuses are made of quartz glass or stainless steel to output best and least-contaminated results. I wish that my study can further 
    help to understand the microplasticsâ€™ behavior and quantify the microplastics pollution not only in the surface but also in the water column and sediments. 
    The teleology of my research is to improve the consciousness of protecting the ocean environment and to provide the latest knowledge and advanced insights of ocean to the public.</h2>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I started my PhD from April, 2023 after 13 months of work. I believe an experience of work can motivate
    me to work smarter, work empirically, work practically. Most importantly, connecting the theoritical 
    knowledge with realistic society and industry is always the pursuit of research.</p>
